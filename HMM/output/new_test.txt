The  Wallabies  have  their  sights  set  on  a  13th  successive  victory  to  end  their  European  tour  with  a  100  percent  record  but  also  want  to  turn  on  the  style  and  provide  David  Campese  with  a  fitting  send-off  in  his  final  match  in  Australian  colours  .

The  ODS  ,  a  party  in  which  Klaus  often  tries  to  emulate  the  style  of  former  British  Prime  Minister  Margaret  Thatcher  ,  has  been  in  control  of  Czech  politics  since  winning  general  elections  in  1992  .

Zieleniec  in  the  summer  led  calls  for  the  party  and  its  leadership  to  listen  to  more  diverse  opinions  ,  a  thinly-veiled  criticism  of  Klaus  who  has  spearheaded  the  country  's  post-Communist  economic  reforms  .

Polish  brewer  Zywiec  's  1996  profit  slump  may  last  into  next  year  due  in  part  to  hefty  depreciation  charges  ,  but  recent  high  investment  should  help  the  firm  defend  its  10-percent  market  share  ,  the  firm  's  chief  executive  said  .

Van  Boxmeer  would  not  say  how  much  higher  1997  profits  or  market  share  could  be  but  said  sales  of  leading  Polish  brewers  should  rise  as  the  country  's  young  urban  professionals  gradually  switch  from  vodka  to  beer  .

"  The  perspective  on  growth  is  such  that  reasonably  we  can  think  that  somewhere  between  65  and  80  litres  per  year  is  certainly  reachable  ,  "  van  Boxmeer  said  on  Polish  per-capita  beer  consumption  ,  currently  around  40  litres  .

Van  Boxmeer  said  Poland  's  top  five  brewers  ,  which  produce  about  55  percent  of  the  country  's  beer  ,  could  all  raise  market  share  as  some  of  the  numerous  small  brewers  fall  to  competition  from  the  large  brewers  with  foreign  investors  .

Van  Boxmeer  said  the  tough  competition  had  prevented  Zywiec  from  raising  prices  in  line  with  inflation  ,  which  had  added  to  the  pressure  on  the  firm  's  margins  .

But  he  said  the  company  's  investment  of  more  than  $  100  million  already  this  decade  ,  largely  in  production  ,  would  help  position  it  to  compete  with  such  competitors  as  brewers  from  the  neighbouring  Czech  Republic  .

Some  analysts  say  cheaper  but  high-quality  Czech  imports  could  invade  Poland  once  tariffs  for  CEFTA  countries  are  lifted  in  1998  ,  but  van  Boxmeer  says  such  a  threat  might  be  exaggerated  despite  the  Czech  beer  market  's  overcapacity  .

Van  Boxmeer  said  Zywiec  had  its  eye  on  Okocim  ,  which  has  said  it  would  start  producing  Carlsberg  beer  next  year  ,  but  that  Zywiec  's  potential  production  of  Heineken  was  a  medium-term  possibility  rather  than  a  short-term  one  .

He  said  his  firm  would  be  better  off  concentrating  on  its  leading  brand  ,  Zywiec  Full  Light  ,  which  accounts  for  85  percent  of  sales  and  is  the  country  's  largest-selling  brand  .

"  You  will  not  win  the  war  of  the  Polish  beer  market  with  imported  international  brands  ,  "  van  Boxmeer  said  ,  adding  that  Heineken  would  remain  an  up-market  import  in  Poland  .

Van  Boxmeer  also  said  Zywiec  would  be  boosted  by  its  recent  shedding  of  soft  drinks  which  only  accounted  for  about  three  percent  of  the  firm  's  overall  sales  and  for  which  7.6  million  zlotys  in  provisions  had  already  been  made  .

The  British  government  warned  Friday  that  it  would  refer  the  proposed  trans-Atlantic  alliance  between  British  Airways  Plc  and  American  Airlines  to  Britain  's  Monopolies  and  Mergers  Commission  unless  the  carriers  complied  with  a  number  of  conditions  .

Trade  and  Industry  Secretary  Ian  Lang  added  that  even  if  the  conditions  were  met  by  both  airlines  ,  final  clearance  would  hinge  on  an  open  skies  deal  between  Britain  and  the  United  States  to  liberalise  trans-Atlantic  air  traffic  ,  which  would  create  greater  competition  on  the  routes  .

New  York  City  on  Friday  said  that  it  planned  a  $  775  million  refunding  for  January  that  will  include  its  first  floating  rate  issue  of  taxable  debt  for  European  investors  .

A  city  official  ,  who  declined  to  be  named  ,  explained  that  Goldman  ,  Sachs  ,  which  this  summer  was  demoted  to  the  second  tier  of  the  syndicate  ,  proposed  the  floating  rate  issue  and  as  a  result  was  promoted  to  book  runner  for  this  offering  .

By  selling  the  floating  rate  debt  ,  the  city  hopes  to  establish  a  benchmark  ,  the  city  official  said  ,  adding  that  it  needed  a  large  deal  to  accomplish  this  objective  .

The  city  in  late  June  sold  its  first  issue  of  Euronotes  ,  a  strategy  that  it  says  saved  it  $  500,000  in  interest  costs  ,  and  it  has  been  trying  to  build  on  this  strategy  of  expanding  the  pool  of  potential  investors  since  then  .

Wall  Street  ,  since  the  bid  ,  has  speculated  that  any  deal  between  Newmont  and  Santa  Fe  would  be  a  "  bear  hug  ,  "  or  a  reluctantly  negotiated  agreement  where  the  buyer  is  not  necessarily  a  friendly  suitor  .

Newmont  ,  in  fact  ,  will  not  benefit  from  the  Santa  Fe  acquisition  on  an  earnings  basis  for  at  least  two  years  ,  which  also  limits  its  capacity  to  raise  its  offer  .

Any  deal  ,  friendly  or  hostile  ,  would  almost  assuredly  be  a  stock  swap  ,  which  is  necessary  to  preserve  the  tax-free  ,  pooling-of-interest  accounting  ,  they  said  .

Lieutenant-General  Maurice  Baril  told  a  news  conference  in  Nairobi  his  main  concern  was  for  a  large  group  of  about  150,000  refugees  living  off  the  land  in  a  valley  about  65  km  (  40  miles  )  west  of  the  eastern  city  of  Goma  .

If  he  decided  it  was  necessary  and  safe  for  the  aircrew  ,  he  would  not  hesitate  to  order  airdrops  of  food  for  the  refugees  ,  even  against  the  wishes  of  the  government  in  Kinshasa  and  the  Zairean  rebels  who  control  much  of  eastern  Zaire  ,  he  said  .

The  ratification  of  the  treaty  ,  which  was  signed  in  1993  by  the  then  right-centrist  government  ,  is  being  delayed  by  an  ex-communist  party  ,  which  won  parliamentary  elections  in  the  same  year  and  now  dominates  parliament  .

The  party  ,  the  Democratic  Left  Alliance  ,  says  the  agreement  would  give  the  Catholic  Church  too  much  influence  over  life  in  Poland  and  could  infringe  on  rights  of  other  religious  groups  and  non-believers  .

Brazil  's  most  sought-after  beauty  treatment  is  liposuction  in  which  fat  is  sucked  away  from  areas  of  the  body  ,  with  about  30,000  operations  a  year  at  a  cost  of  $  3,000  to  $  4,000  each  .

Stomach  tucks  and  breast  operations  are  also  popular  since  the  tropical  climate  calls  for  flesh-baring  fashions  ,  but  unlike  women  elsewhere  Brazilians  tend  to  have  breast  reductions  and  buttock  implants  .

Jordan  said  a  small  group  of  developing  nations  that  oppose  linking  trade  talks  and  labour  conditions  had  pressured  World  Trade  Organisation  (  WTO  )  officials  to  prevent  Hansenne  from  taking  the  platform  to  urge  such  links  .

Lahd  ,  a  69-year-old  former  Lebanese  army  major-general  ,  heads  the  3,000-strong  SLA  militia  which  helps  Israel  hold  a  border  zone  in  south  Lebanon  to  ward  off  cross-frontier  guerrilla  raids  on  northern  Israel  .

The  court  said  inquiry  head  Chris  Hunt  might  be  biased  ,  since  he  privately  told  a  newspaper  he  had  turned  up  no  major  evidence  of  paedophile  activity  ,  even  though  he  still  had  months  '  of  investigation  before  him  .

When  asked  about  the  outlook  for  the  fiscal  year  beginning  in  April  ,  Nukaya  said  the  economy  may  slow  down  in  the  early  part  of  the  fiscal  year  due  to  a  planned  consumption  tax  hike  ,  but  that  would  be  only  temporary  .

For  the  third  consecutive  day  ,  Friday  's  scheduled  training  runs  were  cancelled  due  to  heavy  wet  snow  and  fog  on  Whistler  Mountain  ,  leaving  the  scheduled  World  Cup  events  in  jeopardy  .

"  There  was  no  possibility  today  to  make  a  training  run  ,  "  said  Bernd  Zobel  ,  the  Canadian  men  's  national  coach  ,  citing  too  much  new  snow  and  poor  visibility  .

The  Wallabies  ran  in  five  tries  with  Campese  ,  who  has  retired  from  test  rugby  after  collecting  101  caps  and  a  world  record  64  tries  ,  adding  one  last  touchdown  in  a  Wallaby  jersey  before  departing  the  international  game  .

The  Barbarians  included  14  internationals  but  ,  with  only  two  pre-match  practice  sessions  behind  them  ,  proved  no  real  match  for  a  Wallaby  side  determined  to  finish  their  12-match  tour  unbeaten  .

After  going  four  up  in  the  first  55  minutes  South  Korea  allowed  Indonesia  ,  newcomers  to  Asian  Cup  finals  ,  back  into  the  match  ,  conceding  two  goals  from  rare  counter  attacks  .

Kim  Do  Hoon  opened  the  scoring  for  South  Korea  in  only  the  fifth  minute  ,  turning  unmarked  on  the  penalty  spot  to  fire  a  shot  into  the  top  corner  .

It  looked  like  turning  into  a  rout  as  Hwang  Sun  Hong  rapidly  added  two  more  in  the  seventh  and  15th  minutes  but  although  the  Koreans  continued  to  dominate  they  failed  to  add  to  the  score  before  the  interval  .

But  they  started  the  second  half  where  they  had  left  off  and  it  was  not  long  before  they  went  four  up  ,  Ko  Jeong  Woon  heading  in  from  a  free  kick  in  the  55th  minute  .
